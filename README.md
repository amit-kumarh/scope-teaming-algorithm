## Technical Write Up

### Background of Algorithm (~1-2 paragraphs)

This implementation relies on a Simulated Annealing algorithm, which is a metaheuristic.

* What differentiates it from other algorithms used to solve similar problems?
* Describe the historical context (and how it informed the algorithmâ€™s design, if applicable)
* Strengths and possible shortcomings of the algorithm
* Benefits of using this algorithm/class of algorithms for a set of problems
* Implications of certain design decisions within the algorithm in terms of performance, reliability, robustness, applicability, etc.

### How it Works (Walkthrough)
* How does it work? What components are in its design?
* What are its operating principles? What is the intuition behind its operating principles?
* Original figures/diagrams to aid explanation

### Solving a Problem (~1-2 paragraphs)
* Choose an application that your algorithm can be applied to & explain it
* Discuss how the algorithm would be applied/adapted to the problem as presented
    * Are there alterations that need to be made to the algorithm to enable it to be applied to this problem?
    * Are there key assumptions about the problem that must hold true in order to use this algorithm?
* Other use cases of the algorithm

### Ethical Analysis (~1-2 Paragraphs)
* How might this algorithm be misused?
* Is there bias in the algorithm? Intentional or unintentional?
* How can these concerns be mitigated?
* Back up these claims with 1 or 2 case studies
