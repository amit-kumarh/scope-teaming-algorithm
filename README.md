## Technical Write Up

### Background of Algorithm (~1-2 paragraphs)

This implementation relies on Simulated Annealing, which is a metaheuristic inspired by annealing in metallurgy (a process that involves heating a metal to a high temperature and slowly cooling it down to remove defects in its crystal structure). The algorithm starts at a "high temperature", meaning it is more willing to accept a random solution that is worse than the current solution so it explores a wide range of solutions. As the algorithm "cools down", it becomes less willing to accept worse solutions, allowing it to converge to a solution. Because of this mechanic, this algorithm is better at handling complex, multi-peaked solution spaces than simpler algorithms like local searches, which easily get stuck in a local optima. Compared to other metaheuristics like genetic algorithms or ant colonies, simulated annealing is simpler to refine as it requires tweaking of only one or two parameters (the cooling rate and/or the threshold for when to stop iterating). However, despite all of it benefits, simulated annealing is not guaranteed to find the exact optimal solution and thus falls short when a precise solution is required.

The main design decisions with simulated annealing stem from the parameter values. **Alpha**, the cooling rate, determines how quickly the algorithm will converge to a solution. A low alpha like 0.8 causes the algorithm to converge quickly, but is more likely to not find the optimal solution. A high alpha like 0.99 allows the algorithm to explore more of the solution space (due to its influence on the Boltzmann constant), but takes much longer to converge and uses more computing power. The **threshold** for stopping the algorithm is the other important parameter. A high threshold may cause the algorithm to not converge to a solution. A low threshold may cause the algorithm to take too long to converge.

### Ethical Analysis (~1-2 Paragraphs)

There are ethical dilemmas when using algorithms like this to create student SCOPE teams. For one, there are definite potential sources of bias, whether in the student responses or in the algorithm's heuristics, which might favor certain qualities that benefit some groups over others. There can also be a lack of transparency and privacy concerns regarding how student data is used, and students may feel a lack of agency or that insufficient care was put into their team selection. For instance, our algorithm has several random elements regarding how it traverses the solution space that could potentially have a major influence on the results.

Nevertheless, there are measures that can be taken to address these concerns (many of which are employed by the SCOPE teaching team!). Promoting transparency about the algorithm and the qualities it prioritizes can help reduce the "black box" feeling and increase students' sense of agency. Additionally, transparency into the factors the algorithm considers and prioritizes, and careful consideration of those factors, can help reduce algorithmic bias. Lastly, because there are factors that the algorithm simply cannot fully consider, adding human oversight and intervention is critical â€“ an algorithm-assisted, but ultimately human, process as opposed to an entirely machine-driven one.
